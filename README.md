Welcome to my data analysis portfolio! Here you'll find a collection of projects I've worked on, showcasing my skills in data cleaning, visualization, statistical analysis, machine learning, and so on.

## About Me

I'm a data-driven professional with a background in psychology. I'm passionate about using data and analytics to derive insights and acquire knowledge to improve decision-making. I'm skilled in statistical analysis and data visualization using SPSS, Excel, SQL, Tableau, Python and R.

## Projects

* **Project 1: the Oscar Award**
    * This project contains data from The Academy Awards Database, recorded of past Academy Award winners and nominees between 1927 and 2024. I used statistical techniques to answer questions about the data and report my conclusions and recommendations in a report.
    * Key technologies/tools used (SQL).
    * Link to the project (if it's in the same repository, you can link to the folder. If it's elsewhere, provide the URL).
    * Highlight key findings or accomplishments.  Use visuals if possible!
